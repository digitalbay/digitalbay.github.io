        <p>
			According to dictionary.com, &ldquo; Code (computers) is the symbolic arrangement of statements or instructions in a computer program in which letters, digits, etc. are represented as binary numbers; the set of instructions in such a program &rdquo;<br />

        <p>
			As you can see on the graph below, there has been an exponential growth and development over the years, and along with it a need for people to make the said technology. <br />

			Many people ask &ldquo;What can coding do?&rdquo;, and the usual (and most correct) answer is &ldquo;You should bae asking about what it <em>can't</em> do.&rdquo;<br />
			Coding opens up so many possibilities to the world. You can make apps, webpages (such as this one), games, software, databases, and countless other things. However, there is a problem.<br />
			A very big problem.

		<h2 class="dark">&ldquo;What is this problem?&rdquo; you ask?</h2>
		<p>
			This problem is something that you wouldn't notice unless someone brought it up to you, like how Donald Trump's eyes look exactly like his mouth. 
			<br />
			This problem is plaguing the globe on a massivle scale.
			<br />
			This problem ... is a lack of education in STEM subject education, specifically Computer Sciences, in today's schools.
